## Install PDDL4J-TO Planning System

#### Damien Pellier and Humbert Fiorino created the PDDL4J-TO planning system specifically for the 2020 International Planning Competition. The Hierarchical Total Order planner PDDL4J (Planning domain description library for Java) is available as an open-source library under the LGPL license. PDDL4J is designed to make it easier to construct Java tools for automated planning that are based on the PDDL language. The field of artificial intelligence that deals with the realization of strategies or action sequences, usually for execution by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned vehicles, is called automated planning and scheduling, or simply planning in the relevant literature.
